            Developed during the fall 2022 Multi-Disciplinary Design junior studio in the College of
            Architecture & Planning at the University of Utah, FOLDERS was designed with the idea of
            creating an "online commons", a place where designers can openly & freely collaborate to
            collect, find, & share resources. As designers we have to keep track of many tools &
            inspirations – this tool is designed to not only make it easier, but to encourage a
            community-focused approach in working with other designers.

            The website follows a simple structure of three main tabs, all accessible from the
            landing page & from a drop down menu.
            <br />
            <br />
            The ‘Profile’ tab is the hub for all resources saved by the user. Through folders &
            sub-folders, links can easily be saved, organized, accessed, & shared with others. When
            saving a link, users add tags which inform the algorithm for the ‘Explore’ tab.
            Resources can also be shared directly within Folders to groups & other users.
          </p>

            The ‘Explore’ tab contains the feed of all algorithmically recommended resources as well
            as the folders of other users similar to those of the users. Links & folders can be
            quickly added to the user’s own profile by clicking the blue ‘plus’ icon.
            <br />
            <br />
            The ‘Collab’ tab is where users can find & join groups which cater to their interests.
            By joining these new communities, users are encouraged to work with each other to
            strengthen each other in design. Links from the users’ profile can be quickly shared
            here, & resources can be added to their profile by clicking the blue ‘plus’ icon which
            will automatically appear next to links.
