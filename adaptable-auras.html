              Adaptable Auras is an installation designed to explore & challenge the role technology plays in the
              tradition of art by implementing reproduction & machine learning technologies to create an art piece that
              is intrinsically connected to those who view it. The pen plotter receives data collected from individuals
              in the space using computer vision & converts that data into a unique drawing.

        <p>
          Developed during the fall 2023 Multi-Disciplinary Design senior studio in the College of
          Architecture & Planning at the University of Utah, this project is an art installation
          designed to explore & challenge the role technology & reproduction plays in the creation
          of art.
          <br />
          <br />
          When an artwork is reproduced, its re-contextualization alters its meaning & something
          special about the original is lost. With machine learning & AI image generation, art can
          be created, appropriated, & reimagined by an algorithm, completely removing the role of
          an artist altogether. It is more important than ever to find ways to use these
          technologies to connect us with artwork before they remove us from it.

          The installation consists of a 1369 mm x 1122 mm CNC pen plotter that interfaces with
          attendees in the exhibit space through a camera connected to a custom program. The
          software works to track faces in the space & draw their movements to a canvas, resulting
          in a web of strokes where each vertex represents an attendee who approached & viewed the
          installation – an art piece that is intrinsically connected to those who view it.
